# Chess Engine

## About

A basic command-line chess simulator and engine.
The goal of this project is to simply encapsulate the rules of chess, and to write a basic engine for it.
The quality of the engine, and representations of the data, are constantly evolving to accomodate new efficiency requirements.

## What Does That Mean?

This is super unstable and actively being worked on.

## How Good Is The Engine?

I have no idea. Let's benchmark it against a human!

## TODO

* Reduced reliance on strings, more power-of-two integers please!
* Smarter cloning of the board state
* More consistent use of notation vs. index. Use of index consistently in engine code and related representations
* UI?
* faster language than Python
* actual analytics/metrics, to figure out what is the slow part
